Game Name: Just Tap the Car!
How to play:
Wait for the car to speed across the screen and tap as soon as you can! Essentially just testing your reflexes, but there is an audio cue and a distance indicator to let the player know how soon to expect the car. The lowest distance between the player's click and the car are stored into the high score. Attempts are also incremented to let the player keep track of their attempts. The goal is to try and click directly on the car! If you can do that, you will win! When high scores are set, the player should hear a sound and see stars to let them know their accomplishment.

Controls:
Left click to click the car (or try)
Space to restart the game
R to retry after clicking the car (or trying)

Cheats:
ALT-S: Resets the highscore to be empty
